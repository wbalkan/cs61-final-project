# cs61-final-project

# Description
This project consisted of designing a database to store nutrition information on food from the most popular fast food chains. 
The data was split into 3 tables with [this ERD](https://github.com/wbalkan/cs61-final-project/wiki/Dataset-ERD). 
This database was then created and data was cleaned and imported. Then, the database was hosted with Amazon AWS, which was queried 
by a [backend](https://github.com/wbalkan/fastfood-backend), and connected to a [frontend website](https://github.com/wbalkan/fastfood-nutrition-site). 
The result was the following website which graphically displays a variety of information about fast food nutrition: 
[website](https://fastfood-nutrition-site.vercel.app)
The project wiki contains information about milestones and database setup, and can be found [here](https://github.com/wbalkan/cs61-final-project/wiki)

# Setup
There is no setup required to view this project, only accessing [this link](https://fastfood-nutrition-site.vercel.app).
However, because the backend is hosted on the free tier of Render, it is possible that the visualizations do not populate immediately.
Depending on the time taken for Render to "spin up" the server, the graphics should eventually load with data from the database.

# Supplemental Materials
Code for the website and backend can be found [here](https://github.com/wbalkan/fastfood-nutrition-site) and [here](https://github.com/wbalkan/fastfood-backend)
